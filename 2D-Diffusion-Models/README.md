# ðŸ§  Paper Reading Repository: 2D Diffusion Models

Welcome to my personal paper reading log! This repository documents research papers I've read â€” primarily focused on **2D diffusion models**, **generative modeling**, and related subfields. My goal is to understand the landscape, track trends, and prepare for future research contributions.
